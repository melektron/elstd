# elstd
The ELEKTRON C++ standard library - A C++ standard library extension providing many useful features, utilitys or C++ stdlib extensions. 

## Why elstd?

First of all, __elstd is NOT a optimized and extended replacement of the C++ standard library__. Instead, elstd is an additional C++ library that adds standard features that I frequently need or that I feel are missing from the C++ stdlib. Some features are just for convenience, some to make code shorter and more readable and some add completely new functionality.

## Compatability

Not all features of elstd are compatible with all compilers, OSes and platforms. Some features are explicitly aimed at Windows. However, many features just use the C++ stdlib and can be used with every platform and compiler.

Every feature can be explicitly activated or deactivated to ajust for any requirements.

## Feature list

 * Standardized logging functionality (LOGE, LOGD, LOGI, LOGW, LOGC)
